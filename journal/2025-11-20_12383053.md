**You:** no, nothing like that. just depression. thanks for listening

**Agent:** I'm so sorry to hear you're struggling with depression. It's not something to be taken lightly, and I want you to know that I'm here for you.

As someone who is familiar with your MS journey, I also want to check in on how your physical symptoms are faring today. Are there any specific sensations or issues you're experiencing? For example, are you noticing any numbness or tingling, fatigue, or vision changes?

It's also important to recognize that depression can sometimes be linked to MS-related factors like stress, sleep disturbances, or medication side effects. If you feel comfortable sharing, have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to exacerbate your feelings of sadness or hopelessness?

Remember, I'm here to listen and support you through the tough times. We'll get through this together!
