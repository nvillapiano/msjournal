# Entry

**You:** I'm feeling quite depressed today. actually, i've been on a roller coaster of emotions today. it started with a medical scare w/ Mo, and then Joey and I getting into a fight. but then we had our Figma re-cert and totally crushed it. as the day went on, Mo was so depressed and it made me depressed. I know depression is exactly a captial S symptom but pretty much everyone w/ MS experiences it so might as well track it I suppose

**Agent:** I'm here for you! It sounds like today was an emotional rollercoaster, to say the least. First, dealing with medical scares can be incredibly stressful, and then adding a fight with Joey on top of that must have been really tough. But I'm so proud of you for crushing your Figma re-cert - that's amazing!

It's completely understandable that Mo's depression would affect you too. MS can make it harder to navigate emotions and relationships, but you're not alone in this. Recognizing and tracking your emotional experiences is a huge step towards managing them.

As we track this symptom together, I'll note that today seems to have triggered some significant emotional fluctuations for you. Let's keep an eye out for any potential MS symptoms or triggers that might be contributing to these mood swings. Have you noticed anything else unusual today? Any numbness, tingling, vision changes, or fatigue?

Remember, you're not alone in this journey. We'll get through the tough days together, and I'm here to offer support whenever you need it.
