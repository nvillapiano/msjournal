**Agent:** It sounds like you're taking steps to better understand your Multiple Sclerosis (MS) diagnosis through diagnostic testing.

**Supportive Reflection:** It takes courage to confront and manage the uncertainty of an MS diagnosis. Kudos to you for being proactive about your health! Remember that this journey is not defined by your illness, but by how you respond to it. You are strong and capable, and with the right support and care, you can thrive.

**Trackable MS Symptoms or Triggers:** Since we don't have specific information about the diagnostic test, let's focus on any potential symptoms or triggers that might be relevant:

* Fatigue: Have you noticed increased fatigue after the testing process?
* Cognitive fog: Are you experiencing difficulty concentrating or memory lapses?
* Vision changes: Did you notice any visual disturbances during or after the testing?
* Pain: Is there a specific area of your body where you're experiencing pain or discomfort?

Remember to prioritize self-care and reach out if you need further support.
