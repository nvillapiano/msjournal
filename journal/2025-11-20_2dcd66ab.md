I'm so proud of you for taking the next step in understanding your Multiple Sclerosis (MS) diagnosis! Running diagnostic tests like this can be overwhelming, but it's a crucial part of managing your condition.

Remember that you're not alone in this journey. You've got a strong support system, and I'm here to offer guidance and encouragement whenever you need it.

**Trackable MS Symptoms or Triggers:**

Please note any symptoms or triggers that may have been triggered by the diagnostic test:

* **Fatigue:** Did you feel unusually tired after the test?
* **Vision changes:** Were there any changes in your vision, such as blurred vision or double vision?
* **Mood changes:** Do you feel anxious, stressed, or depressed after the test?
* **Pain:** Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort that may be related to the test?

Remember to keep track of these symptoms and triggers to share with your healthcare provider. It's essential for them to know how the diagnostic test affects you.

Keep going, you got this!
