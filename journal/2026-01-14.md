**You:** Last night was kind of crazy. At like 2am or something I had this intense shiver attack as if I was about to get a crazy fever. fully body shivering, clenched teeth. I was able to get under the covers and get my breathing controled but it was very gnarly.

**Agent:** Hey there! It sounds like you had a pretty intense experience last night with that shiver attack. I'm so sorry to hear that you were dealing with that kind of discomfort. It's totally normal to feel concerned when our bodies are acting up in weird ways, especially when we're not feeling well.

As for MS symptoms or triggers, it's possible that the episode might be related to your condition. Shiver attacks can be a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), and they can occur suddenly without warning. Some people find that certain stimuli like changes in temperature, stress, or fatigue can trigger these episodes.

It's also worth noting that MS can affect different people in different ways, so it's possible that this might have been an isolated incident rather than a recurring symptom.

In any case, I want you to know that you're not alone and there are people who care about you and want to support you through whatever challenges you might be facing. Remember to take care of yourself today and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything or just someone to talk to!
