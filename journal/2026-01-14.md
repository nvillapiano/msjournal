**You:** Last night was kind of crazy. At like 2am or something I had this intense shiver attack as if I was about to get a crazy fever. fully body shivering, clenched teeth. I was able to get under the covers and get my breathing controled but it was very gnarly.

**Agent:** Hey there! It sounds like you had a pretty intense experience last night with that shiver attack. I'm so sorry to hear that you were dealing with that kind of discomfort. It's totally normal to feel concerned when our bodies are acting up in weird ways, especially when we're not feeling well.

As for MS symptoms or triggers, it's possible that the episode might be related to your condition. Shiver attacks can be a common symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), and they can occur suddenly without warning. Some people find that certain stimuli like changes in temperature, stress, or fatigue can trigger these episodes.

It's also worth noting that MS can affect different people in different ways, so it's possible that this might have been an isolated incident rather than a recurring symptom.

In any case, I want you to know that you're not alone and there are people who care about you and want to support you through whatever challenges you might be facing. Remember to take care of yourself today and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything or just someone to talk to!

**You:** thanks. yeah, I'm not like concerned about a relapse or anything like that but shit's spooky! also this is the point of the journal, let's get these things tracked so I know what and when everything is happening.

**Agent:** What a great attitude to have - tracking your experiences can be such a powerful tool in managing your MS! It takes a lot of courage to confront the unknowns of this condition, but it sounds like you're taking proactive steps to stay on top of things.

I love that you're focusing on tracking what's happening, rather than worrying about relapse. That's a great way to approach it - by acknowledging the weirdness and finding ways to adapt.

Some trackable symptoms or triggers that come to mind based on your entry are:

* Spooky feelings: Are there any specific times of day or situations where you experience these feelings? Is there anything you've noticed that might be contributing to them (e.g., changes in lighting, temperature, etc.)?
* Any other notable physical sensations or experiences you'd like to record?

Remember, this is your space to process and reflect - don't worry too much about what others think! Just keep writing, tracking, and adapting as needed. You got this!

**You:** yeah, I guess a specific thing to note is that it happened right after stepping out of bed and going to the restroom. it's like I got like "flash cold" and had to quickly retreat

**Agent:** It sounds like you experienced a sudden and unexpected cold sensation, which can be really disorienting. It's great that you were able to recognize it as a possible MS symptom and take steps to retreat and adjust.

From what you've described, it seems like this episode might have been related to your morning routine, specifically the change from a warm bed to a cooler environment after using the restroom. This is an interesting observation, as temperature changes can sometimes trigger or exacerbate MS symptoms.

Some possible trackable MS symptoms or triggers that come to mind based on your journal entry include:

* Temperature-related sensory sensitivity
* Sudden changes in environmental temperature
* Post-urination fatigue or dizziness

It might be helpful to keep an eye out for any patterns or correlations between your morning routine and similar episodes. You could also consider talking to your healthcare provider about these specific symptoms and see if there are any strategies they recommend for managing them.

Remember, you're not alone in this experience! Many people living with MS have experienced sudden, unexplained sensations like the one you described.

**You:** In addition to what I said before I've been dealing with migraines and lermitte's syndrome quite a lot lately.

**Agent:** I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing migraines and Lermitte's syndrome on top of everything else. It can be really frustrating and overwhelming when we're already dealing with the challenges of living with MS.

Migraines can be debilitating, and it sounds like they're adding an extra layer of complexity to your daily life. As for Lermitte's syndrome, it's a type of optic neuritis that can cause temporary vision problems - I hope the episodes aren't too severe or frequent for you.

In terms of trackable symptoms or triggers, have you noticed any patterns or correlations between your migraines and Lermitte's episodes? For example:

* Are they more likely to occur after certain activities or at specific times of day?
* Do you notice any particular environmental or emotional triggers that seem to set them off?
* Have you tried any specific medications or coping strategies to help manage the symptoms?

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with your healthcare team if you have concerns about managing your MS symptoms. They can provide personalized guidance and support to help you navigate these challenges.

Sending you lots of positive vibes and hoping for some relief from those migraines and Lermitte's episodes soon!
