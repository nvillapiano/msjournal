**You:** Last night was kind of crazy. At like 2am or something I had this intense shiver attack as if I was about to get a crazy fever. fully body shivering, clenched teeth. I was able to get under the covers and get my breathing controled but it was very gnarly.

**Agent:** I'm so sorry you had to go through that! It sounds like your body was giving you quite the scare. As someone who's familiar with MS, I want to acknowledge that those intense shiver attacks can be really unsettling.

In terms of tracking potential MS symptoms and triggers, it's interesting that this episode happened at 2am - is there anything you were doing around that time that might have triggered it? Were you stressed about something or feeling anxious? Sometimes our bodies can get overwhelmed by external factors (like stress) or internal ones (like fatigue), which can exacerbate MS symptoms.

Remember, taking care of yourself is crucial! Have you been getting enough rest and taking breaks when needed? Are there any specific self-care habits we could explore to help mitigate those shiver attacks in the future?

Feel free to share more about what happened, or if there's anything I can do to support you through this.
