**You:** I felt pretty lousy over the weekend. Very active cold sensations in my left arm and whole left side, really. Lots of "electricity" feelings. Had to cancel plans on each day. Also wrapped up in it was feelings of depression.

**Agent:** I'm so sorry to hear that you were feeling unwell over the weekend. It sounds like you may have experienced some relapse symptoms, specifically numbness or tingling sensations in your left arm and side (which can be a common symptom of Multiple Sclerosis). The "electricity" feelings could also be related to MS-related neural activity.

Additionally, it's not uncommon for people with MS to experience depression and anxiety alongside their physical symptoms. It's great that you recognized the need to cancel plans and prioritize your well-being during this time.

As we reflect on this experience, let's try to identify any potential triggers or patterns that may have contributed to these symptoms:

* Was there anything in particular that triggered these symptoms (e.g., stress, fatigue, certain foods/drinks)?
* Are there any specific times of the day or week when you tend to experience more frequent or severe symptoms?
* Have you noticed any other changes or patterns in your physical or emotional well-being lately?

Remember, it's essential to prioritize self-care and communication with your healthcare team during these episodes. Let's work together to develop a plan for managing your symptoms and improving overall quality of life.
